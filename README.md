# Audio3D
This is a web application for rendering audio files in 3D space with several manipulations for some fun eye-candy. It can work on any device capable of running WebGL, at the exception of iOS, since iOS does not support Web Audio API (more specifically createMediaElementSource).

Upcoming plans:
* Complete idling screen to more clearly show users must click on the canvas
* Allow users to use their own music, possibly through the usage of URL arguments
* Clean up and optimise some portions of code
