# Audio3D
This is a web application for rendering audio files in 3D space with several manipulations for some fun eye-candy. It can work on any device capable of running WebGL, at the exception of iOS, since iOS does not support Web Audio API (more specifically createMediaElementSource).

Upcoming plans:
* Allow users to use their own music, potentially with user accounts that can have playlists, either by mp3 upload or YouTube links as sources
* Clean up and optimise some portions of code
* Add more visualisations, and allow customisations of visualisers, tied to songs

[WebApp Demo is available here at trenavix.com!](https://trenavix.com/audio3d/)
